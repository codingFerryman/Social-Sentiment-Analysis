This work is based on a course project we finished in ETH Zurich, you can find the snapshot of the project submission in [this branch](https://github.com/codingFerryman/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/tree/ethz-cil-project2-2021-submission) or [my teammate's repo](https://github.com/supernlogn/Computational-Intelligence-Lab), which also includes [README with details](https://github.com/codingFerryman/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/ethz-cil-project2-2021-submission/readme.md). Big thanks for the contribution from my smart colleagues [Ioannis](https://github.com/supernlogn) and [Levin](https://github.com/moserle)!
